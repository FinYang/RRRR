\details{
The formulation of the reduced-rank regression is as follow:
\deqn{y = \mu +AB'  x + D z+innov,}
where for each realization \eqn{y} is a vector of dimension \eqn{P} for the \eqn{P} response variables,
\eqn{x} is a vector of dimension \eqn{Q} for the \eqn{Q} explanatory variables that will be projected to
reduce the rank,
\eqn{z} is a vector of dimension \eqn{R} for the \eqn{R} explanatory variables
that will not be projected,
\eqn{\mu} is the constant vector of dimension \eqn{P},
\eqn{innov} is the innovation vector of dimension \eqn{P},
\eqn{D} is a coefficient matrix for \eqn{z} with dimension \eqn{P*R},
\eqn{A} is the so called exposure matrix with dimension \eqn{P*r}, and
\eqn{B} is the so called factor matrix with dimension \eqn{Q*r}.
The matrix resulted from \eqn{AB'} will be a reduced rank coefficient matrix with rank of \eqn{r}.
The function estimates parameters \eqn{\mu}, \eqn{A}, \eqn{B}, \eqn{D}, and \eqn{Sigma}, the covariance matrix of
the innovation's distribution.

The algorithm is online in the sense that the data is continuously incorporated
and the algorithm can update the parameters accordingly. See \code{?update.RRRR} for more details.

At each iteration of SAA, a new realisation of the parameters is achieved by
solving the minimisation problem of the sample average of
the desired objective function using the data currently incorporated.
This can be computationally expensive when the objective function is highly nonconvex.
The SMM method overcomes this difficulty by replacing the objective function
by a well-chosen majorising surrogate function which can be much easier to optimise.

SMM method is robust in the sense that it assumes a heavy-tailed Cauchy distribution
for the innovations.
